Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.

L356829  u6379  m425  CHARLOTTE  Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.

L644900  u8830  m599  BUD  Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.

L60488  u416  m25  HELEN  You treated me like shit.
L619379  u3324  m220  VIPER  I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.

L120326  u4331  m289  ACE  It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

L445439  u2486  m161  BINGY  Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.

L393641  u2138  m139  JEFFERSON  Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.

L619764  u8524  m578  HARRY  I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.

L569264  u3125  m204  RIPLEY  Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
L42407  u3681  m243  ALVY  Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
L392125  u6664  m445  ARTHUR  Yes, Lord.

And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...

He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

L567478  u8077  m547  TERMINATOR  My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
L103475  u603  m38  DIGNAN  Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.

L101957  u596  m37  SMECKER  These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?

L218911  u5324  m353  SAMIA  John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
L618645  u3313  m220  COUGAR  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
L160106  u4790  m319  FINNEGAN  I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.

L621484  u8536  m579  BUZZ  I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
L633180  u8677  m588  JOHN  Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
L114293  u4288  m286  LEONARD  No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
L197817  u5145  m341  KINDERMAN  Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
