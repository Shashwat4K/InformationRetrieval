L360562  u1951  m127  MAX  Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?

L86507  u508  m32  ELLA MAE  Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite.

L367883  u6454  m429  ARAMIS  D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?

L42662  u3695  m243  ROB  No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.

L434274  u6980  m467  FOLEY  It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.

L162747  u771  m49  MRS. BRUCE  If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.

L461934  u2586  m168  JUDY  Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
L401843  u6737  m449  BRUCE  Excuse me ?
L423822  u2378  m152  ELLEN  You mean... George McCord, the actor?

L254531  u5648  m374  SECOND MAN  Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?
L512663  u7668  m518  MARSHA  Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
L355821  u1882  m123  MYSTERY MAN  Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
L328836  u6149  m409  GRANT  A well-accepted theory.

L190366  u5074  m336  ED  With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

L481806  u7394  m500  ESPERANZA  Tell me.

L126934  u4411  m293  ADAM  What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
L229794  u1049  m68  TOMMY  Pedal to the metal...
L242638  u1155  m76  COMMODUS  Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
L375255  u2045  m132  JOHN  You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.

L454821  u2526  m163  SEXY VOICE  So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
L28361  u3605  m238  LLOYD  You'd have been proud of her.

L454590  u2521  m163  LENA  Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
L255408  u1213  m79  MYRA  You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
L206579  u910  m59  LINDA  There's nothing to it.
L428965  u6932  m463  TURKLE  What?
L547970  u7877  m532  WALT  Who are these from?
L401399  u6737  m449  BRUCE  Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
L267247  u1244  m82  PENELOPE  Doing what?
L202702  u5201  m344  KATE  I think it�s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It�s very human.

L95915  u4139  m276  KRISTINA  What do you want from me?
L133831  u4505  m298  KANE  It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
L285288  u1386  m91  ROGER  Sod.
L305846  u6015  m399  MALLOY  Did he die in the fire?
L291124  u5918  m391  EDDIE  You said that was an accident.
L576242  u8164  m554  FROCK  That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
L134909  u4540  m299  VERONICA  Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.

L89174  u4081  m272  BLADE  I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
L566919  u3088  m202  MIKE  Yeah.
L146462  u4646  m308  LETTY  I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.

L195321  u875  m56  JULIAN  What guy?
L29677  u3635  m239  WOODWARD  It is.
L110368  u638  m40  PRINCESS  He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
L236946  u1106  m72  REBECCA  Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
L125896  u4421  m293  REGGIE  I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
L169041  u785  m50  GRETCHEN  Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
L296455  u1426  m95  VIRGINIA  It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
L23531  u3579  m236  BROUSSARD  Sure.
L661033  u3497  m230  GRADY  A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.

L407398  u6789  m453  LINNEA  Doesn't it have a name?
L449019  u7106  m476  ANN  Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.

L384687  u2080  m135  AISHA  1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
L333862  u1672  m110  BRIAN  It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
L151580  u4729  m314  FRIDA  Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
L226714  u5431  m361  RANDY  Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?

L113534  u4279  m285  JENNIFER  The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
L36202  u312  m19  FRANK  I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
L89685  u4078  m271  SCUD  Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
L509532  u2788  m182  LYNN  You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
L487050  u7516  m507  STU  Sorry.
L496391  u2675  m174  MARY  Which room is it?
L84307  u493  m30  JENNY  Go.
L134969  u4535  m299  RANDAL  I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
L460517  u7221  m487  DADDY  Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
L219510  u5345  m355  FLETCH  I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?

L387525  u6612  m441  ANNIE  As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.

L440541  u7042  m471  JOE  I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs!

L438531  u7026  m469  RICHARD  The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four�eyed worm.

L450666  u7142  m479  VIVIAN  Three.
L276232  u5813  m385  LARRY  And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.

L527926  u7806  m528  BETH  You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.

L370777  u2012  m130  MRS. PILLETTI  Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.

He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.

L542627  u3042  m199  FOX  We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
L345473  u1765  m117  DONOVAN  I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?

L506553  u2762  m180  PADEN  Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
